Hi! My name is Eric Li and I'm currently a sophomore in mechanical engineering and computer science at North Carolina State University.
My repositories include projects either from class or other projects I complete as I learn other programming languages outside of class.
I am interested in obtaining an internship or relevant experience in the engineering field and am open to learning new skills and technologies!
Please reach out to me at lieric446@gmail.com if you have any questions! Thanks!
